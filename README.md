## **Inspiration**

As a software developer, I often found myself manually evaluating the time and space complexity of algorithms, which could be tedious and error-prone. During hackathons, I realized there was a need for a tool that could automate this process, allowing developers to focus on solving problems rather than worrying about the performance of their code. **AlgoMate** was born out of this need to streamline the code optimization process.
