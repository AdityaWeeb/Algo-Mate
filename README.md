# **AlgoMate: Code Review Assistant**

**AlgoMate** is a **Chrome Extension** designed to assist developers by instantly analyzing the time and space complexity of their algorithms. It provides real-time feedback and suggests improvements, making it easier to write efficient and optimized code. Perfect for hackathons, students, and developers looking to improve their code!

---

## **Inspiration**

As a software developer, I often found myself manually evaluating the time and space complexity of algorithms, which could be tedious and error-prone. During hackathons, I realized there was a need for a tool that could automate this process, allowing developers to focus on solving problems rather than worrying about the performance of their code. **AlgoMate** was born out of this need to streamline the code optimization process.

## **Features**

- **Code Complexity Analysis**: Instantly evaluates the time and space complexity of your code.
- **Suggested Improvements**: Provides real-time recommendations for optimizing your code's efficiency.
- **Responsive UI**: A sleek and user-friendly interface designed for a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile.
- **Dark Mode**: A toggle to switch to dark mode, ideal for developers who prefer a darker theme.
- **Integration with Gemini AI**: Uses the Gemini API to analyze the code and provide insights.
